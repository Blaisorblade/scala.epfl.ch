[Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org) is a catalogue of open source libraries. It’s automatically generated based on data collected from Github and Maven Central. 

Scaladex aims to be a one-stop index to go to get all info about a project. Use it to find which releases are compiled for a specific Scala version or backend (including Scala.js and Scala Native), or use it to map out the different modules made up by a large project. Scaladex additionally lays out different artifacts' dependencies, and whether those dependencies are compile or test dependencies. Scaladex even points users to Scaladocs generated for each artifact!
