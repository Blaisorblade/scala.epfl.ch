description: "Next-generation compiler for Scala"
---
[Dotty](http://dotty.epfl.ch/) is a platform to try out new language concepts
and compiler technologies for Scala with a focus is mainly on simplification.
Eventually, Dotty is planned to become Scala 3.  The Scala Center contributes
to the development of Dotty on several fronts

- Migration tool ([scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix))
- Community build ([lampepfl/dotty-community-build](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-community-build))
- Reporting incompatibilities with Scala 2.x ([dotty/issues](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/created_by/olafurpg))
- Benchmark infrastructure ([scala/compiler-benchmark#31](https://github.com/scala/compiler-benchmark/pull/31))
- Next generation macros ([scalamacros/scalamacros](https://github.com/scalamacros/scalamacros))
