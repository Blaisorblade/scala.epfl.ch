Our mission is to develop quality and widely accessible educational materials,
and to make them freely available. We have launched 4 courses along with a
capstone project on Coursera. All courses can be taken for free (without a
certificate).

We have also created a [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/scala_tutorial/terms_and_types)
interactive tutorial that is based off of our above MOOCs. Walk through the
material of the functional programming in Scala MOOCs as an interactive
tutorial!
