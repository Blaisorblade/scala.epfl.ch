This initiative focuses on improving day-to-day tools that all Scala developers depend on: [Zinc](https://github.com/sbt/zinc) and [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt).

Our involvement in these projects have helped them to improve on the following
topics:
1. Reproducibility.
2. Performance.
3. Usability.
4. Documentation.
5. Welcoming experience to OSS developers.

To see our contributions to Zinc [follow this link](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/labels/Scala%20Center).
  
To see our contributions to sbt [read this thread](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/reply-to-your-feedback-on-sbt/89://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/reply-to-your-feedback-on-sbt/892).

We keep improving these tools every day, so the previous links may miss some of our contributions.
We keep the community updated over [Scala Contributors](contributors.scala-lang.org), drop by and chime in!
The project is open to any suggestion to improve these tools.
